## Migration Guide: v0.1.0 → v0.2.0

### Automatic Compatibility
- **No code changes required** - All existing v0.1.0 code continues to work
- **Dependencies**: Update `Cargo.toml` to `botanica = "0.2"`
- **Testing**: All existing tests pass without modification

### Optional Professional Features
Add professional capabilities incrementally:

```toml
# Minimal upgrade (no changes required)
botanica = "0.2"

# Add Darwin Core for scientific data exchange
botanica = { version = "0.2", features = ["darwin-core"] }

# Add conservation tracking
botanica = { version = "0.2", features = ["darwin-core", "conservation"] }

# Enable all professional features
botanica = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
```

### New Professional APIs
```rust
// Darwin Core (optional)
#[cfg(feature = "darwin-core")]
use botanica::darwin_core::*;

// IUCN conservation (optional)
#[cfg(feature = "conservation")]
use botanica::conservation::*;
```

### Performance Impact
- **Basic features**: No performance impact
- **Professional features**: < 2% overhead per enabled feature
- **Memory usage**: Scales linearly with enabled features
- **Binary size**: Professional features add ~500KB when enabled
