# Botanica Roadmap

Botanica is a production-ready botanical database with AI-powered plant insights.
Its mission is **invisible botanical infrastructure**: drop it in, it works.

## Current Milestones
- ✅ Complete taxonomic hierarchy (Family → Genus → Species).
- ✅ Scientific nomenclature with authority citations and publication tracking.
- ✅ Professional cultivation management with growth stages and environmental tracking.
- ✅ Optional ContextLite AI integration for plant recommendations.
- ✅ 69 comprehensive tests with zero unsafe code.

## Next Goals
- [ ] Enhanced search and filtering capabilities across all taxonomic levels.
- [ ] IUCN Red List integration for conservation status updates.
- [ ] Herbarium specimen management with location and collector data.
- [ ] Phenology tracking for seasonal growth patterns.
- [ ] Advanced cultivation analytics and yield optimization.
- [ ] GraphQL API layer for modern application integration.

## Long-Term Vision
- Complete botanical research platform covering all major plant families.
- Integration with major herbarium databases and botanical institutions.
- AI-powered species identification from photographs and descriptions.
- Climate adaptation modeling for conservation planning.
- Open data exchange with global botanical databases.
- Mobile app companion for field research.

## Philosophy
Botanica will remain **free forever** under MIT license. Scientific research deserves scientific-grade tools without paywalls or feature restrictions.
